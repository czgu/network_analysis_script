How to comile:
    make
How to run:
    ./finder {input_file} {output_file} [t: num_threads] [s: num_samples] [d: is_directed] [m: motif_size]
for example:
    ./finder network.txt output.txt t8 s10000 d0 m34
    which runs motif finder on network.txt with 8 threads (t8) and over 10000 samples (s10000). The network input should be undirected (d0) and the analysis is for motif of size 3 to 4.

    {} are required fields
    [] are optional fields
    default values for optional fields:
        num_threads: 4
        num_samples: 10000
        is_directed: false
        motif_size: 3 to 4

Input format:
    Currently the only format is an list of edges/arcs of vertex ids. For example:
    1 2
    2 3
    1 3
    if the graph is directed, then motif finder reads graph as there are arcs from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 1 to 3.

Files:
    main.cc: parse the user input and start motif sampler
    motif.h: contain the motif sampling algorithm
    graph.h: store graph as a adjacency list
    time.h: used for time diagnostics
